## this repository belongs to the codes of a famous financial problem in the literature of stochastic programming in which by having 55 dollars, 3 decisions must be made in 3 5-year preiods to invest on bonds or stock. the goal is to have at leat 80 dollars after 15 years. the decision tree can be seen as follows.

## The return of stock and bond are given by the following table. Please note that the returns were first sampled from unifrom distributions, then reduced with the hierarchichal scenario reduction algorithm.
